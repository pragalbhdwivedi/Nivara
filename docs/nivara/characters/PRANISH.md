# Pranish

## Role
Pranish is a rare “Chosen of Stillness,” a living correction to human chaos and Winter’s answer when war grows too loud.

## Domain
- **Frost Oaths**: Silence, restraint, endings.
- **Winter’s balance**: Not good or evil, but the force that restores equilibrium.

## What “Chosen of Stillness” Implies
- Winter selects a champion to end wars and correct imbalance.
- Pranish embodies stillness that can arrive as a blizzard or a woman with two swords.
- She answers to winter itself rather than any court or crown.

## Rumors vs Reality
- **Rumor**: Pranish is the White Court’s servant and weapon.
  - **Reality**: She is not their servant, even if the Veil-Mothers fear her.
- **Rumor**: Wherever Pranish walks, winter follows and wars end.
  - **Reality**: She is Winter’s answer when chaos grows too loud, not a constant storm.
- **Rumor**: Pranish is an omen of endings with no mercy.
  - **Reality**: She embodies balance and stillness, not malice or cruelty.
