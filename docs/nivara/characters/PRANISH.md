### Origin & Lore
- Born in the high borderlands where winter never fully retreats and steel rusts slower than memory.

- Not cruel—but utterly decisive.
- Speaks little; when she does, people listen.
- Protects civilians instinctively.
- Carries quiet guilt, not regret.
- She does not seek redemption; she seeks balance.

### Symbolism
- Snow — silence after chaos.
