## Identity Lock — NIMRA “LOCKBREAK” KAEL

### ChatGPT (Identity Lock Prompt)
Character Identity Lock: NIMRA “LOCKBREAK” KAEL  
Woman, 26–30. Medium wheatish-to-warm beige skin tone with a sun-kissed coastal undertone, natural texture. Face shape: heart-oval mix—slightly wider at cheekbones, tapering to a softly pointed chin (not sharp). Eyes: dark brown, slightly upturned at the outer corners, alert and playful; a “knows the shortcut” look. Eyebrows: thicker, slightly messy-natural, confident shape. Nose: small-to-medium, straight with a subtle slope at the bridge. Lips: medium-full with a smirk default; smile is asymmetric (one corner lifts more).  
Hair: dark brown to black, shoulder length or tied back messy, a few loose strands framing the face.  
Defining detail: one small scar near the eyebrow or cheek (subtle, not dramatic).  
Expression: mischievous, calculating charm—never innocent.  
Strict consistency rules: keep the exact same asymmetric smirk, eye tilt, eyebrow thickness, face taper, scar placement, and warm coastal skin tone across all images. No face drift, no glam model look, no age change.

Optional negatives:  
no different scar location, no big anime eyes, no porcelain skin, no perfectly symmetrical smile, no sharp v-line chin.
