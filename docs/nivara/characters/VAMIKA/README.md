# Matron-Echo Vamika

## Character Visual Sheet (4/8) — Matron-Echo Vamika

### Face Vibe
- Serene, maternal, unnervingly certain.
- Gentle smile that feels like a verdict.
- Eyes: calm, ancient, listening to something behind the world.

### Outfit Silhouette
- Ceremonial robe-layering: inner fitted gown + outer draped mantle.
- Thread-crown (red woven threads shaped like a halo/circlet).
- Long sleeves, flowing hems, ritual sashes that move like music.
- No armor—her power is ritual and voice.

### Palette
- Bone white, deep wine red, charcoal black.
- Accent: thin gold stitch lines (minimal, sacred geometry feel).

### Signature Prop
- Resonance beads (prayer-bead style, used to count verses).
- A hymn-scroll or stitched ribbon of prophecy lines.
- Optional: a small bell (never rung—only carried).
