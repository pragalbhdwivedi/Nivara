## A Short Myth / Song of Pranish
(folk-ballad style; sung in taverns and by soldiers who don’t like remembering)

They say the North has many winters,
and each one has a name—
but there is one that walks on footsteps
and answers to no flame.

No banner rides behind her,
no horn admits her near,
yet every war grows quiet
when Pranish draws her steel-clear.

**Chorus**
Hush now, hush—let the snow descend,
Let iron learn to bend,
For where her shadow crosses ground,
The fighting meets its end.

A king once bought ten thousand blades,
to break the mountain pass;
Pranish came with two small swords
and turned his gold to glass.

She did not take his crown away,
she did not crave his throne—
she took the need for any king
to claim the dead as own.

**Chorus**
Hush now, hush—let the snow descend,
Let iron learn to bend,
For where her shadow crosses ground,
The fighting meets its end.

Some swear she’s sworn to winter gods,
some swear she’s winter’s bride;
some say the storm is only fear
that follows where she strides.

But mothers light a candle
when the roads are red with stain,
and whisper, “White Silence, hear us—
send her steps like falling rain.”

**Final Chorus**
Hush now, hush—let the snow descend,
Let iron learn to bend,
For where her name is spoken low,
The war will break… and end.
