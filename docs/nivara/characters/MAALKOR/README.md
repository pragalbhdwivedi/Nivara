# Maalkor

## Role
Maalkor leads the Ash Dominion, an infection of frenzy rather than a nation. He is the force that turns grief into riots and makes peace feel humiliating.

## Domain
- **Ash Oaths**: Rage, crowds, forgetting.

## Leadership and Methods
- Rules alongside the Ash-Brides, war-oracles crowned in soot and gold.
- Can erase names from memory, creating “ghost wars.”
- Frames the Melt as liberation: “The world is tired of silence.”

## Pranish’s Nemesis

### Name
Maalkor Veyran

### Title
The Ash-Speaker (also called “The Warm Death” by survivors).

### What He Is
Not a king. Not a demon. Not even fully human anymore. Maalkor is a war-priest turned pyro-ritualist, a man who learned to feed conflict into fire-magic until flame became his language.

Where Pranish brings silence, Maalkor brings noise—drums, riots, speeches, hunger, frenzy. He doesn’t just fight wars. He writes them.

### His Power
Maalkor can’t “throw fire” like a basic wizard. He’s worse. He practices Ash Oaths:
- He burns names off records so people forget the dead.
- He ignites rage in crowds (mass panic, mass zeal).
- He can turn a battlefield’s smoke into living ash, a choking swarm that blinds and brands.

His signature effect is called **Ember-Memory**: when Maalkor marks someone, they relive their worst moment in heat-haze hallucinations until they break.

### Why He’s Her Nemesis
Pranish ends wars. That’s her nature.

Maalkor believes peace is a lie that weak rulers sell to keep power. He thinks war is the only honest engine of history. He targets her not because she’s strong, but because she’s anti-his religion.

He calls her: “A blade that steals the world’s momentum.”

### Mirror Dynamic (Why They Feel “Fated”)
- **Pranish**: controlled, surgical, quiet, merciful in her restraint.
- **Maalkor**: theatrical, contagious, loud, merciless in his persuasion.

Pranish can defeat armies. Maalkor can defeat civilizations by making them destroy themselves.

### Their First Collision (Lore Hook)
Pranish once ended a siege without killing anyone—she disarmed both sides and walked the civilians out through snow.

Maalkor arrived after and burned the empty fortress anyway. Not for strategy. For a message.

He carved a symbol into the blackened stone with heat: a spiral of ash, his mark, and beneath it: “YOU CANNOT SAVE THEM FROM WANTING WAR.”

That is when Pranish decided he wasn’t just another enemy. He was a disease.

### Nemesis Sigil
A black spiral with a single ember dot at the center. Meaning: everything returns to flame.

## Pranish Canon Addendum
Maalkor leads the Ash Dominion with his Ash-Brides, turning grief into riots and making peace feel humiliating.
