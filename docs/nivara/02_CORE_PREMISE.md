## Winter Chooses Champions
In Nivara, Winter is a force that chooses champions. It is not “good” or “evil,” only balance. When war grows too loud, winter answers.

- That answer is sometimes a blizzard.
- Sometimes it is a woman with two swords.

## Pranish: Chosen of Stillness
Pranish is one of the rare “Chosen of Stillness”—a living correction to human chaos. She is Winter’s answer to imbalance and the clearest embodiment of the stillness that ends conflict.

## Pranish Canon Addendum
