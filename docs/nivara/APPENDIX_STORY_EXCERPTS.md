## Pranish — First Appearance Scene
Snow should not have been falling in the valley of Ash-Tyr. The mapmakers swore this place was dust and stone—an old wound in the world where nothing clean could survive.

Yet the snow came anyway.

It arrived as a thin, deliberate veil, sifting down through smoke and torchlight, turning the battlefield’s shouting into something muffled and far away. The banners—red, gold, black—hung heavy as wet cloth. Men argued over whose dead belonged to which side. Horses stamped, nervous, as if they could smell a predator that didn’t have a scent.

At the ridge above the pass, a lone figure stood where the wind hit first.

No army behind her. No standard. No drummer calling her name.

Just silver-and-white armor that caught the pale light like a shard of moon, and a mantle of fur that moved with the breeze as though it breathed. A thin line of frost crept along the stones at her feet, not spreading wildly, not showing off—simply existing, like a law being enforced.

Someone below finally noticed. A scout, then two. Then the shouting shifted, the way a crowd changes when a rumor turns into a fact.

“Who’s that?”
“A deserter?”
“A witch?”
“A saint?”
“A bounty?”

Pranish didn’t answer any of them. She didn’t even move.

She looked down at the valley the way a surgeon looks at an infected wound—no disgust, no fear, only decision.

A captain of the southern host stepped forward, lifting his sword and his voice together.

“You there! Name yourself!”

The woman’s eyes found him. Almond-shaped, steady, dark as river stones under ice. The expression on her face was calm, almost soft—except for the small confidence in her mouth, a smile that wasn’t friendly and wasn’t cruel. It simply said: I have measured you.

Pranish spoke once, and the words carried strangely well in the snow.

“Leave the children.”

The captain blinked, thrown off by the simplicity. “What—”

“Leave them,” she repeated, quieter. Somehow it sounded more final.

Behind him, a group of villagers—too thin, too scared—huddled near a broken cart. A boy clutched a pot like it was armor. A girl held a smaller child whose face was tucked into her shoulder, trying to pretend war was just loud weather.

The captain recovered his pride. “You don’t give orders here.”

A laugh rose somewhere in the ranks. It died quickly when the horses began to back away.

Pranish descended.

No dramatic leap, no flare of magic—just steps. Yet each step tightened the air. Snow gathered around her boots as if drawn there, and the frost line behind her traced a clean path down the slope.

Archers raised bows. Their hands trembled.

A mercenary—brave or stupid—charged first. He swung a broad blade meant to break shields and bones.

Pranish tilted her head, like she was listening to something beyond him.

Then she moved.

It wasn’t speed like lightning. It was speed like inevitability. Her sword came out as if it had always been there, and the mercenary’s weapon met empty air. She didn’t strike him with a flourish. She simply removed his ability to continue.

He fell hard, not dead—disarmed in every meaning of the word. His blade lay in the snow, rimmed with frost.

The valley went silent in the most terrifying way: not because people were forced to be quiet, but because something in them chose it.

The captain barked a command anyway. Pride is a stubborn disease.

A wave surged forward.

Pranish’s second blade appeared—smaller, shorter, meant for close work. She stepped into the rush and the world narrowed around her, the battlefield turning into a private geometry: angles, distances, weight shifts, breath.

Steel rang.

Snow swirled.

Men stumbled as if the ground had betrayed them. Frost slicked boots at precisely the wrong moment. Straps snapped. Blades slipped. Shields turned heavy as regret.

She never overreached. Never chased. Never wasted motion. The way she fought made it look as if the war had been written badly, and she was correcting the grammar.

A soldier lunged for her face—an ugly, desperate thrust.

Pranish caught the weapon on her guard, leaned in close enough that he could smell clean winter on her armor, and said softly, almost kindly:

“Stop.”

He did. Not because she commanded him, but because his body understood before his mind did: continuing would be pointless.

Around them, the charge collapsed into confusion. The southern host tried to regroup. The northern host tried to exploit the chaos. Both failed, because the battlefield no longer belonged to either of them.

It belonged to Pranish.

She reached the broken cart where the villagers huddled.

The boy with the pot stared at her as if looking at a story that had walked out of a book. “Are you… are you here to save us?”

Pranish looked down at him, and for the first time her expression shifted—so slightly it could have been a trick of the falling snow.

“I’m here,” she said, “to end this.”

She turned back to the armies, raising one blade just high enough for both sides to see it. Not a threat. A boundary.

“Walk away,” she called, voice steady. “Or I will teach your bones what winter means.”

A hush, then a ripple of fear disguised as anger.

Someone fired an arrow.

It flew straight for her throat.

Pranish lifted a hand—barely a gesture—and the air thickened. The arrow slowed as if it had entered deep water, then dropped into the snow at her feet, harmless and ashamed.

She didn’t look at the archer.

She looked at the captain again.

The captain swallowed. He’d wanted a victory song. He’d gotten a warning written in frost.

One by one, the soldiers backed away. The northern host followed. Nobody wanted to be the person who learned what came after her patience ended.

As the armies withdrew, the snow eased—almost satisfied. Torchlight dimmed. The valley breathed for the first time in weeks.

Pranish walked to the edge of the pass and sheathed both blades with the quiet finality of a door closing.

The villagers didn’t cheer. They didn’t know if cheering would break the spell.

The boy stepped forward, brave now that it was safe. “Will you stay?”

Pranish looked out into the white distance, where storms waited like old friends.

“No,” she said.

“Where will you go?”

She paused, as if considering the question seriously—then the faintest curve returned to her lips.

“Wherever the world forgets how to be silent.”

And then she was gone, swallowed by snow and wind, leaving behind only frost on stone and a valley that would never again pretend war was ordinary.
