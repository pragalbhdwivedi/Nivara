# Central Conflict: The Melt

## What The Melt Is
A phenomenon spreads across Nivara called The Melt. It is not warmth and not spring, but a wrongness:

- Snow falls in deserts.
- Rivers freeze in summer.
- Sometimes winter refuses to come at all, leaving rot instead.

## Faction Interpretations and Pranish’s Response
- **The White Court (Veil-Mothers)**: Believe someone is breaking the old Oaths and damaging the world’s balance.
- **The Ash Dominion (Maalkor)**: Claims the Melt is liberation: “The world is tired of silence.”
- **The Iron Sanctum**: Calls it an opportunity: “If nature is unstable, law must become permanent.”
- **The Blood Choir**: Panics as their visions fracture into static.
- **Pranish**: Feels the Melt in her bones like a blade vibrating before it breaks.

## Pranish Canon Addendum
The Melt is a wrongness: snow falls in deserts, rivers freeze in summer, and winter sometimes refuses to come at all, leaving rot instead. The Veil-Mothers believe someone is breaking old Oaths; Maalkor claims liberation: “The world is tired of silence.” The Iron Sanctum calls it an opportunity: “If nature is unstable, law must become permanent.” The Blood Choir’s visions fracture into static, and Pranish feels it in her bones like a blade vibrating before it breaks.
