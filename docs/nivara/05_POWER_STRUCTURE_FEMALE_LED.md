# Power Structure (Female-Led)

## Why Legitimacy Flows Through Women
Nivara’s strongest powers are not kings with swords, but matriarchal orders that control oaths, trade routes, and legitimacy. The world’s levers are held by women who decide:

- who may wage war
- who may be crowned
- whose name will be remembered

Legitimacy flows through:
- oath-keepers
- seers
- architects
- war-oracles
