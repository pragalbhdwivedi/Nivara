# Magic System: Oaths & Elements

## Overview
Magic in Nivara is not learned like school. It is bound by oaths and expressed through elements tied to those oaths.

## The Three Rules
1. No power without an oath.
2. Every oath has a cost.
3. Breaking an oath leaves a “scar” on reality (storms, rot, madness, hunger).

## The Four Oath-Factions
- **Frost Oaths** → silence, restraint, endings (Pranish’s domain)
- **Ash Oaths** → rage, crowds, forgetting (Maalkor’s domain)
- **Iron Oaths** → law, contracts, structures, empires
- **Blood Oaths** → lineage, sacrifice, devotion, prophecy

## Glossary
- **Oath**: The binding source of magical power in Nivara.
- **Scar**: The consequence of breaking an oath, leaving reality damaged (storms, rot, madness, hunger).
- **Chosen of Stillness**: A rare champion selected by Winter to correct human chaos.
