## Plot Outline — Book/Season 1: Pranish: White Silence
(8 episodes / 8 major chapters — tight, cinematic, female-led)

### Episode 1 — Snow in the Dunes
- In the desert region Khal-Dune, snow begins falling at noon. People call it a miracle; the Veil-Mothers call it a warning.
- A convoy carrying civilians is attacked by two rival militias fighting over “winter water.”
- Pranish appears and ends the clash without killing—disarms, disables, forces retreat.
- A survivor recognizes her: “White Silence… she’s real.”
- Final beat: a burnt symbol found near the site—the Ash Spiral.
- **Hook**: Winter is misbehaving. Someone is forcing it.

### Episode 2 — The Veil-Mothers’ Offer
- The White Court sends an envoy: Lady Sairi of the Veil, calm and terrifyingly diplomatic.
- She offers Pranish a formal role: Silencer Prime—an oath-backed mandate.
- Pranish refuses; she doesn’t serve courts.
- Sairi drops a truth: The Melt has begun. Oaths are breaking.
- Meanwhile, the Iron Sanctum issues a bounty: “Bring the Frostbound Blade alive.”
- **Hook**: Everyone wants Pranish—ally, weapon, prisoner.

### Episode 3 — The City of Locks
- Pranish enters an Iron Sanctum city to find a stolen artifact called the Quiet Key (rumored to bind or break oaths).
- We meet the female antagonist from the Sanctum: Arch-Architect Lys Marrow, elegant, ruthless, brilliant.
- Lys tries to trap Pranish in a contract-prison: a legal spell that “locks” movement.
- Pranish escapes by choosing pain: she partially breaks her own Frost Oath to slip free—leaving a small scar on reality.
- **Hook**: Even Pranish can be forced into oath-breaking… and that has consequences.

### Episode 4 — Song of the Blood Choir
- The Blood Choir invites Pranish to their cathedral of echoes.
- The Choir’s leader: Matron-Echo Vamika, serene, terrifying, motherly.
- They reveal something wild: Pranish is missing from prophecy—a “blank verse.”
- Vamika suggests Maalkor wants the blank verse because it can rewrite fate.
- Pranish refuses their “blessing” (another attempt to bind her).
- As Pranish leaves: a Choir seer collapses screaming: “Ash is eating the names.”
- **Hook**: Maalkor’s power is expanding beyond battlefields—into memory itself.

### Episode 5 — The Ash-Bride
- Pranish faces one of Maalkor’s champions: Ash-Bride Kalyra (female-led rival, mirror character).
- Kalyra fights like a dance—fire, chains, ecstatic fury.
- The duel is brutal. Pranish wins, but Kalyra laughs while bleeding: “He doesn’t need to beat you. He only needs to make you choose.”
- Pranish finds civilians safe… but their memories are damaged—some can’t recall their own children’s names.
- **Hook**: Maalkor’s war isn’t about killing bodies. It’s about erasing identity.

### Episode 6 — The Melt Spreads
- Snow falls in the wrong places; in the north, winter fails and the dead don’t stay quiet—rot spreads.
- The White Court admits the unthinkable: the ancient Frost Oaths were anchored by an artifact now missing—the Winter Heart.
- Evidence points to a black market of oath-artifacts controlled by smugglers on the Sable Coast.
- Pranish goes alone; Sairi secretly follows with a small female-led escort (no men in command).
- **Hook**: The world’s balance is physically unanchoring.

### Episode 7 — Sable Coast: The Market of Broken Vows
- The Sable Coast is fog, wrecked ships, oath-smugglers, and whispered bargains.
- Pranish locates the Winter Heart and discovers it has been split into pieces.
- The buyer’s name: Maalkor Veyran.
- Iron Sanctum agents strike. A three-way battle breaks out: Sanctum vs smugglers vs Veil escort.
- Pranish almost collapses from overuse—cold fatigue hits hard.
- Sairi saves her, proving loyalty without ownership.
- **Twist**: The Sanctum doesn’t want the Winter Heart to restore balance; they want it to build a permanent “law winter” under their control.

### Episode 8 — Ash-Tyr: The Loudest Fire
- Maalkor stages a massive ritual battle in the valley of Ash-Tyr, designed to: (1) fuel an ash-storm, (2) erase thousands of names, (3) reforge reality into endless war.
- Pranish arrives—front-facing, calm, battered, absolute.
- She confronts Maalkor at the ritual center. He doesn’t fight first—he speaks: “Peace is just war in prettier clothes.”
- The final conflict is not sword vs sword. It’s stillness vs frenzy.
- Pranish makes a terrible choice: she uses the Winter Heart fragment to expand the White Silence Field across the valley—ending the ritual, saving lives… but deepening her oath-scar.

### Final Hook / Season End
- Maalkor escapes, but not empty-handed.
- He steals a small fragment: the Blank Verse Shard—something that can rewrite prophecy.
- The Blood Choir’s final line: “Next winter will not choose you, Pranish… it will demand you.”

### Season Themes
- Power without ownership (female leadership vs control).
- Identity, memory, and the cost of endings.
- Peace as a fragile technology, not a moral slogan.
