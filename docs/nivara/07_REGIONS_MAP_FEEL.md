# Regions (Map Feel)

## Key Regions
- **Veylspire Range (north)**: Endless winter passes; White Court territory.
- **Khal-Dune Expanse (south)**: Deserts where snow now falls—Maalkor’s experiments.
- **Iron Meridian Cities (east)**: Gleaming fortress-metropolises of contracts and locks.
- **The Sable Coast (west)**: Ship graveyards, fog, and oath-smugglers.

## Travel/Smuggling Notes
Movement is shaped by permissions and oaths: winter passages can be refused by the White Court, contracts bind routes in the Iron Meridian, and oath-smuggling thrives along the Sable Coast where fog hides forbidden dealings. The Melt makes travel unreliable, freezing rivers in summer and shifting where snow can fall.

## Pranish Canon Addendum

Travel is shaped by winter passage, binding contracts, and oath-smuggling along the Sable Coast, while the Melt makes routes unreliable.
